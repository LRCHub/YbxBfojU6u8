[00:24.97] Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
[00:30.03] I've got a lot of things to learn
[00:37.10] Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
[00:42.03] Before my heart starts to burn
[00:57.03] 
[00:48.90] So what's the matter with you?
[00:55.22] Sing me something new
[00:59.13] Don't you know the cold and wind and rain, don't know
[01:03.44] They only seem to come and go away
[01:20.44] 
[01:13.24] Times are hard when things have got no meaning
[01:18.22] I've found a key upon the floor
[01:25.16] Maybe you and I will not believe in
[01:29.88] The things we find behind the door
[01:46.88] 
[01:36.66] So what's the matter with you?
[01:42.79] Sing me something new
[01:46.67] Don't you know the cold and wind and rain, don't know
[01:50.85] They only seem to come and go away
[02:07.85] 
[02:01.38] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[02:12.65] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[02:23.62] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[02:34.72] Stand by me, nobody knows (nobody knows)
[02:43.68] Nobody knows (yeah, nobody knows)
[02:49.48] The way it's gonna be
[02:59.98] 
[02:57.94] If you're leaving will you take me with you?
[03:02.76] I'm tired of talking on my phone
[03:09.65] There is one thing I can never give you
[03:14.44] My heart could never be your home
[03:30.94] 
[03:21.30] So what's the matter with you?
[03:27.36] Sing me something new
[03:31.31] Don't you know the cold and wind and rain, don't know
[03:35.37] They only seem to come and go away
[03:52.37] 
[03:45.73] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[03:56.78] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[04:08.01] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[04:19.05] Stand by me, nobody knows (nobody knows)
[04:27.32] Yeah, nobody knows (yeah, nobody knows)
[04:33.41] The way it's gonna be
[04:43.91] 
[04:39.36] The way it's gonna be, yeah
[04:45.36] Maybe I can see, yeah
[04:51.06] Don't you know the cold and wind and rain, don't know
[04:55.31] They only seem to come and go away, yeah
[05:15.31] 
[05:05.57] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[05:16.42] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[05:27.59] Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
[05:38.33] Stand by me, nobody knows (nobody knows)
[05:46.42] Yeah nobody knows (nobody knows)
[05:52.87] The way it's gonna be
[06:03.37] 
[05:57.99] That'll do
